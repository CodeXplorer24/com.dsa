 Head -> A -> B -> C -> D -> null      where D is the tail

         Head is not a node itself — it’s a variable (or pointer) that stores the address of
         the first node (A).
         Head stores or points to the address of the first node
         tail stores or points to the last node or element

         last node points to null means there aren't any nodes next to it
         A node contains data and pointer(reference) to the next node
