There are many format specifiers we can use. Here are some common ones:

%c - Character
%d - Decimal number (base 10)
%e - Exponential floating-point number
%f - Floating-point number
%i - Integer (base 10)
%o - Octal number (base 8)
%s - String
%u - Unsigned decimal (integer) number
%x - Hexadecimal number (base 16)
%t - Date/time
%n - Newline

As strings are immutable in Java for ex String a = "Kumar" here variable
reference from stack memory is pointing to the Kumar stored in heap memory
and if we changed a like a = "Carl" then a will not pointing toward the
Kumar thus it will dereference and point to carl.

 String a = "Kumar"; object is Kumar
 a = "Carl"; object changed to Carl

 We can use the string builder to prevent a to build new object
 every time its value is changed.
